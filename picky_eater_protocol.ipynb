    "\n",
    "### 👨‍🍳 2.1. Chef Agent (Idea Generation)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role:** The creative initializer. It takes a high-level user request (e.g., \"simple pasta\") and generates a complete, detailed recipe proposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Instruction:** Strict formatting is required to ensure downstream agents can parse the Name, Description, and Key Ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tooling:** Uses the built-in Google Search tool for up-to-date recipe concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚨 2.2. Censor Agent (Constraint Enforcement)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role:** The strict enforcer. It is provided with a \"Family Blacklist\" (e.g., Onions are forbidden) via its system instruction. It analyzes the Chef's proposal and returns a simple, unambiguous verdict: APPROVED or REJECTED: [Item].\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Logic:** This agent performs zero-shot classification based purely on context. It is designed to be highly reliable and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💰 2.3. Analyst Agent (Logistics & Reporting)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Role:** The logistics expert. If a recipe is approved, its task is to execute a custom, defined function to generate a cost-and-time report for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Tool:** Uses the custom calculate_logistics tool, which simulates access to structured, proprietary data (e.g., a time-to-cook API), proving the multi-agent system's ability to integrate external functions."
